## Functionality

The orchestrator streamlines your deployment process through the following core capabilities:

### 1. Deployment Management

* **Trigger**: Deployments can be initiated via a REST API endpoint (`POST /deploy`), a CLI command (`orchestrator deploy`), or automated CI/CD webhooks.
* **Process**:
    * Validates incoming deployment requests, ensuring image availability and proper configuration.
    * Updates the designated idle Deployment (e.g., `green` if `blue` is active) with the new application image.
    * Intelligently scales up the newly updated Deployment and waits for all new pods to report as `Ready` via Kubernetes probes.

### 2. Traffic Management

* **Blue-Green Deployment**: Once the new version is healthy, the orchestrator atomically switches traffic by updating the Ingress or the primary Service's selector to point to the new Deployment's Service. This ensures an instantaneous switch with minimal user impact.
* **Canary Release (Optional)**: For more granular control, the orchestrator can integrate with a service mesh (e.g., Istio) to gradually shift a percentage of traffic to the new version, allowing for phased rollouts and controlled exposure to new features.

### 3. Health Monitoring

* **Kubernetes Probes**: Continuously checks the readiness and liveness of pods managed by the Deployments.
* **Prometheus Metrics**: Actively queries Prometheus for critical application-level metrics such as error rates, request latency, and resource utilization. These metrics are vital for making informed decisions during phased rollouts and for triggering automated rollbacks.

### 4. Rollback Capabilities

* **Automated Rollback**: A critical safety feature. If pre-defined health checks fail or Prometheus metrics exceed configurable thresholds (e.g., error rate > 5%, latency spikes), the orchestrator automatically reverts traffic to the previous stable version.
* **Manual Rollback**: Provides an escape hatch through dedicated API endpoints (`POST /rollback`) and CLI commands, allowing human intervention to revert to a previous state if issues are detected.

### 5. CI/CD Integration

* **Webhooks**: Configurable webhooks allow seamless integration with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, etc., enabling automated deployments upon successful build and test cycles.
* **REST API**: The comprehensive API offers programmatic control over deployments, allowing custom scripting and integration into any automated workflow.

## Standout Features

These capabilities differentiate the Kubernetes Zero-Downtime Deployment Orchestrator:

* **Automated Rollback with Intelligent Metrics**: Moves beyond simple health checks by incorporating real-time application performance metrics from Prometheus to make smart, data-driven rollback decisions, significantly reducing MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery).
* **Multi-Cluster Support**: Provides the foundation to manage deployments across geographically distributed or logically separated Kubernetes clusters from a single orchestrator instance, enhancing scalability and disaster recovery postures.
* **Highly Customizable Strategies**: Offers fine-grained control over deployment behavior. Users can define custom strategies (e.g., canary percentage increments, specific health check thresholds) via intuitive configuration files, adapting the orchestrator to diverse application needs.
* **Detailed and Auditable Logging**: Every significant action, status change, and decision made by the orchestrator is logged in a structured format with timestamps and outcomes. This robust auditing trail is invaluable for compliance, post-mortem analysis, and debugging.

## Operation in Production

* **High Availability**: The orchestrator runs as a standard Kubernetes Deployment, benefiting from Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities, ensuring it remains operational.
* **Secure API**: The REST API is secured with HTTPS and integrates with Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), accessible by default on port `8080`.
* **Concurrency**: Built with Go's goroutines, the orchestrator efficiently handles multiple concurrent deployment requests without bottlenecks.
* **Resilience**: Implements robust retry mechanisms and configurable timeouts for Kubernetes API interactions and external health checks, ensuring reliability even in transient network conditions.
* **Security First**: Employs TLS for all API communications, utilizes API keys for client authentication, and enforces Kubernetes RBAC for granular access control.

## User Interaction

Interact with the orchestrator through a flexible set of interfaces:

### REST API

The primary programmatic interface for automated systems.

* **Deploy**: `POST /deploy`
    * Initiates a new application deployment.
* **Status**: `GET /status`
    * Retrieves the current status of ongoing or recent deployments.
* **Rollback**: `POST /rollback`
    * Triggers a manual rollback to the previously stable version.

### CLI

A convenient command-line interface for manual operations and scripting.

* Example Deployment:
    ```bash
    orchestrator deploy --app myapp --version v2 --namespace production --strategy blue-green
    ```
* Example Status:
    ```bash
    orchestrator status --app myapp
    ```
* Example Rollback:
    ```bash
    orchestrator rollback --app myapp
    ```

### Webhooks

Integrate directly with your CI/CD pipeline to trigger deployments automatically. Webhooks are secured with HMAC signatures for integrity.

### Example API Call

Here's an example `curl` command to trigger a blue-green deployment:

```bash
curl -X POST [https://orchestrator.example.com/deploy](https://orchestrator.example.com/deploy) \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_SECURE_API_KEY" \
     -d '{
           "app": "myapp",
           "namespace": "production",
           "blue_deployment": "myapp-blue",
           "green_deployment": "myapp-green",
           "blue_service": "myapp-blue-service",
           "green_service": "myapp-green-service",
           "ingress": "myapp-ingress",
           "new_image": "myregistry/myapp:v2.0.0",
           "strategy": "blue-green",
           "metrics_thresholds": {
             "error_rate": 0.05,
             "latency_ms": 200
           }
         }'
````

## Deployment Workflow

The orchestrator guides your application through a well-defined deployment process:

1.  **Trigger Deployment**: A user or CI/CD pipeline initiates a deployment request.
2.  **Update Idle Environment**: The orchestrator updates the currently inactive Deployment (e.g., `green`) with the new application image.
3.  **Health Verification**: It verifies the health and readiness of the new pods using Kubernetes probes.
4.  **Traffic Switch**: Once healthy, it switches the Ingress/Service to direct all traffic to the newly updated (e.g., `green`) Service.
5.  **Monitor & Rollback**: It continuously monitors real-time application metrics via Prometheus. If metrics degrade or health checks fail, an automatic rollback to the previous stable version is triggered.
